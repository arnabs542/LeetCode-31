There are a row of n houses, each house can be painted with one of the three colors: red, blue or green. The cost of painting each house with a certain color is different. You have to paint all the houses such that no two adjacent houses have the same color.

The cost of painting each house with a certain color is represented by a n x 3 cost matrix. For example, costs[0][0] is the cost of painting house 0 with color red; costs[1][2] is the cost of painting house 1 with color green, and so on... Find the minimum cost to paint all houses.

# Solution



```cpp
int minCost(vector<vector<int>>& costs) {
    int n = costs.size();
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        costs[i][0] += std::min(costs[i - 1][1], costs[i - 1][2]);
        costs[i][1] += std::min(costs[i - 1][0], costs[i - 1][2]);
        costs[i][2] += std::min(costs[i - 1][0], costs[i - 1][1]);
    }
    return (n == 0) ? 0 : (std::min(costs[n - 1][0], std::min(costs[n - 1][1], costs[n - 1][2])));
}
```

We can optimize above solution to have O(1) space complexity.

```cpp
class Solution {  
public:  
    int minCost(vector<vector<int>>& costs) {  
        if (costs.empty()) return 0;  
        int n = costs.size(), r = 0, g = 0, b = 0;  
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {  
            int rr = r, bb = b, gg = g;   
            r = costs[i][0] + min(bb, gg);  
            b = costs[i][1] + min(rr, gg);  
            g = costs[i][2] + min(rr, bb);  
        }  
        return min(r, min(b, g));  
    }   
};
```
